## Introduction to HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses elements and tags to structure and display content on the web.

## Headings

HTML headings are used to define the titles and subtitles on a web page. There are six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` the least.

- `<h1>`: Main heading
- `<h2>`: Subheading
- `<h3>`: Sub-subheading
- `<h4>`: Sub-sub-subheading
- `<h5>`: Sub-sub-sub-subheading
- `<h6>`: Sub-sub-sub-sub-subheading
