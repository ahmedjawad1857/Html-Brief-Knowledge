## Programming

Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code in a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or Java.

## HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage using various elements and attributes.

## Basic Structure

The basic structure of an HTML document includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>` element, `<head>` section, and `<body>` section.

## World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URLs, interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Each element represents a specific piece of content or a functional component on a webpage.

## HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They modify the behavior or appearance of an element and are specified within the element's opening tag.

## Nested Elements

HTML allows nesting elements inside other elements, creating a hierarchical structure. This allows for the organization and grouping of content on a webpage.

## Image Tag

The `<img>` tag is used to embed images in an HTML document. It requires a `src` attribute specifying the path to the image file.

## Formatting Tag

HTML provides formatting tags such as `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<mark>`, `<small>`, `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<sub>`, and `<sup>` for applying formatting styles to text.

## Anchor Tag

The `<a>` tag, also known as the anchor tag, is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources. It requires an `href` attribute specifying the URL of the linked resource.

## Style Attribute

The `style` attribute is used to apply inline CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles to individual HTML elements. It allows for the customization of the appearance and layout of elements.

## Headings

HTML headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are used to define the hierarchical structure of a document's sections. They range in size from the most important (h1) to the least important (h6).

## Paragraphs

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text in an HTML document. It creates a block-level element with space above and below it.

## Title Attribute

The `title` attribute is used to provide additional information about an element. It typically appears as a tooltip when the user hovers over the element with their mouse cursor.
